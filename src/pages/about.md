![Valerie Ward](../images/valeriewardprofile.jpg)

Hi, I'm Valerie Ward, but you can call me Val. Born and raised in Newport, Tennessee, I grew up surrounded by hills, fields, and endless sky. Poetry has been my passion since childhood, a way to explore and process the world.

After studying at [University of Tennessee](https://www.utk.edu), my husband and I moved to Billings, Montana. While working in education and raising a family, I continued writing — and now, with *Poems About Everything*, I’m sharing my work.

If you're reading my poems, know some are polished while others are evolving. Feel free to share kind thoughts or feedback via val[at]poemsabouteverything.com.
